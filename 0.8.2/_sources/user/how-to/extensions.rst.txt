VSCode Extensions
-----------------

VSCode has some great extensions for working with Python files. Let's make sure 
those are installed now. 

Click on the extensions Icon and type ``pylance``. Click on ``install`` for 
the two Microsoft extensions listed.

   Adding Extensions

These extensions add syntax based colouring to your Python files and also
will verify your code. If you see a red squiggly line under some of your 
code then it means that your code is not valid. If you hover your mouse 
over the squiggly line you will see a message saying what is wrong.
