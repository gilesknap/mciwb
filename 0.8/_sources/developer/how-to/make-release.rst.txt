Make a release
==============

To make a new release, please follow this checklist:

- Choose a new PEP440 compliant release number (see https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
- Go to the GitHub release_ page
- Choose ``Draft New Release``
- Click ``Choose Tag`` and supply the new tag you chose (click create new tag)
- Click ``Generate release notes``, review and edit these notes
- Choose a title and click ``Publish Release``

Note that tagging and pushing to the main branch has the same effect except that
you will not get the option to edit the release notes.
