# Installation

## Check your version of python

You will need python 3.8 or later. You can check your version of python by
typing into a terminal:

```
$ python3 --version
```

## Create a virtual environment

It is recommended that you install into a “virtual environment” so this
installation will not interfere with any existing Python software:

```
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
```

## Installing the library

You can now use `pip` to install the library and its dependencies:

```
$ python3 -m pip install mciwb
```

If you require a feature that is not currently released you can also install
from github:

```
$ python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/gilesknap/mciwb.git
```

The library should now be installed and the commandline interface on your path.
You can check the version that has been installed by typing:

```
$ mciwb --version
```
