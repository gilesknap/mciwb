Minecraft Interactive World Builder
===================================

This project is intended as a fun way to learn the Python Programming Language.

Experienced Python programmers can also use this library to create
Minecraft worlds with interactive Python features.


For the Reddit discussion see  
`HERE <https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraftbuilds/comments/11rqauh/build_things_using_python>`_

Quick Start
-----------

To get started learning Python, see
`Introduction <https://gilesknap.github.io/mciwb/main/user/tutorials/00-prereq.html>`_

For existing Python developers, see
`API documentation  <https://gilesknap.github.io/mciwb/main/user/reference/api.html>`_

Example Build
-------------

The pagoda and castle with working portcullis were all created programmatically
with Python and the current version of MCIWB.

Goals
-----

Minecraft Interactive World Builder's goals are:

 - Use Python to create anything inside of Minecraft worlds.
 - Call Python code when events occur inside the world.
 - Use an iPython prompt to interact with the world by typing Python commands
 - Have your player inside the world execute Python code by placing command
   signs or activating switches/levers with Python actions.

All instructions on how to set up a Minecraft Server and the Python developer
environment are included. There are step by step tutorials to
introduce Python Programming and the features of Minecraft Interactive World
Builder.

.. note::

    This is a work in progress. There are now enough tutorials to learn the
    fundamentals of Python and enough functionality to have some fun
    interacting with Minecraft from Python code.

    I will continue to expand the tutorials and add more features to the
    library.

Credits
-------

This project would not be possible without `mcipc <https://github.com/conqp/mcipc/>`_,
which provides the client library for Minecraft RCON.
