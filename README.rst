# mciwb Minecraft Interactive world builder

Additional functions on top of the mcwb world builder library to allow
interactive world building using ipython and a minecraft client in
tandem.

Intro
=====

The interaction is achieved by dropping command signs into the world.
You can also switch back to the iPython console and execute commands.

To initiate an interacive session create a Copy object and pass the
player’s name. See demo.py for example usage.

The player will be given one of each of the command signs currently
available. The player can then invoke these commands and indicate a
block location by placing one of these signs in game.

See the following video for a quick sample of the capabilities:

Interactive Commands
====================

So far we have the following signs to drop. See demo.py for example
usage. (video shows start and stop signs which are now combined into
‘select’)

When you drop a sign you must be facing it. It will disappear when the
sign has been detected by the poller and the function has executed.

Note that the sign’s target coordinates are the block **behind** it and
a free standing sign targets the block below it.

-  **select**: set the start and stop point for the copy buffer, the
   last two uses of this command determine the bounding box of the copy
   buffer. The last use determines the anchor point for the next paste
-  **expand**: expand the closest face of the copy buffer to the
   indicated point (can do all 6 faces)
-  **paste**: clone the contents of copy buffer to the current indicated
   location (anchored at the start point)
-  **clear**: clear the contents of the paste buffer
-  **backup** create a zipped and dated backup of the world

Todo Interactive Commands
=========================

-  **shift**: shift the copy buffer until the closest face is at the
   indicated point

Useful iPython Commands
=======================

Using iPython you can also interact with the same Copy object your
player is using in the game.

The following useful commands are available on the Copy class:

-  **shift**: shift the copy buffer in any dimension
-  **expand**: expand the copy buffer by moving one of its faces
   outwards
-  **paste**: paste at the paste location with offset. Can be used in a
   loop to make repeating structures.
-  **restore**: restore the world to a previous backup

Demo 
====

To try out the demo functions 

- create a server with flat world and connect your client to it
- clone the repo
  - git clone git@github.com:gilesknap/mciwb.git
  - cd mciwb
- create a venv and install mciwb
  - virtualenv .venv
  - source .venv/bin/activate
  - pip install -e .[dev]
- launch with your server and player details
  - mciwb --server nuc1 --port 31001 --player TransformerScorn
- Move your player to observe 0,4,0
- type these commands into iPython
  - import demo.shapes as cool
  - pos = pos = mc.Position(0,4,0)
  - cool.pyramid( pos, 11)

an 11 x 11 pyramid will be created

Todo iPython Commands
=====================

-  **save**: save the copy buffer to a named file

-  **load**: load a file into the world at the copy buffer start point.
   Set the copy buffer to enclose the loaded structure

-  **rotate**: perform transforms on the copy buffer

-  Additional support in mcwb required (profile generators)

   -  **rectangle**: make a rectangle described by copy buffer corners
      (expects one of the copy dimensions to be size 1)
   -  **elipse**: make a elipse described by copy buffer corners
      (expects one of the copy dimensions to be size 1)
