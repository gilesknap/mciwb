Introduction
============

Welcome to Minecraft Interactive World Builder (MCIWB).

This series of tutorials will teach you some of the basics of programming
in Python by writing code that interacts with a Minecraft world.

As we work through many of the fundamental concepts of Python, we will
gradually build our own Minecraft Village with some very unusual features!

There are a few things you will need before you start:

- A Desktop or Laptop Computer
- The computer may have any recent version of Windows (10/11), MacOS or Linux 
- An understanding of basic arithmetic including negative numbers
- An interest in learning to program and build cool things in Minecraft

Thats it, a pretty short list.

If you have any problems running any of the tutorials, have questions or 
would like to suggest new features or improvements, please create an issue
by clicking ``New Issue`` on this page
https://github.com/gilesknap/mciwb/issues

When you are ready click ``Next`` to begin.

Happy programming!
